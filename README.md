# Face-Recognition-System
This project leverages deep learning techniques for automating attendance management. The system uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect and recognize faces in real-time from images or video feeds. It matches recognized faces against a stored database of enrolled users and marks attendance accurately. The project ensures high accuracy, security, and efficiency, making it ideal for classrooms, offices, or other organizational environments. Key features include real-time face recognition, database management, and integration with camera systems for seamless operation.
